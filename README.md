# ProjectionRenderer
Computer Graphics HW5

For this assignment, you will build a projection renderer on top of your scenegraph work from HW4.
* Part 1: Add color to your HW4 scenes by inserting new “surface” nodes to the scenegraph.
* Part 2: Define the posing method for a camera and the transformations used to put world-space points into the canonical view volume.
* Part 3: Implement the perspective transform to make a simple wireframe rendering, built on top of Matplotlib's line-plotting capabilities.
* Part 4: Implement backface culling, z-buffering, triangle rasterization, and incidence-based coloring to directly render your own picture of the scene.

See scene.py for resulting screenshots: one of a wireframe rendering, one of a rendering produced by Mayavi, and three produced by my raster renderer.
